# AutoCoder

## Description
AutoCoder allows you to build a Class object file in java using a Java Swing Application

## Background
Auto Coder is a project that I have created by myself. It was born of seeing the IDE Eclipse provide auto-generated code such as setters, getters, etc. Many java projects may end having similar code because of similar algorithms used. The aim of AutoCoder is to simply create files and write up classes with functions and algorithms that the user may want to include. Some of the possible choices of functions are different sorting algorithms and file reading/writing functions. The user will also be able to add instance variables. The program will run with a Java Swing GUI, where the user will be able to fill in the dynamic form to create the class file that is wanted. 
I believe this project address two main needs. One is that it is a step closer to code automation. Obviously this is not the most sophisticated program with flashy machine learning heuristics, but at the end of the day, it is creating code for you. The second impact it has is on education. There are a lot of people that learn how to program by themselves. It can useful having a program that will create a class correctly to compare against your own code. 

## How to Run AutoCoder
* Run the AutoCodeGUI.java file to start the program.
* Enter a Class name and optionally some instance variables
* Choose which helper function you would like to be added to your class
* Provide the file path of the folder where you want your new java file. Ex. C:\Documents\Code\
* The filename will automatically be the class name you provided with a .java extension

## Other Comments
* Currently it takes inputs as is, so if you mispell a variable type, it will not appear correctly

## Possible Future Improvements
* Adding more functions that can be added to the class
* Adding the option to add custom code into the class
* Pre-loading the correct libraries based on the code used in the functions
* Allowing for more control over the function parameters/mechanism
